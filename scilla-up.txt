Scilla (1670) The diversity of colours increases little; these are thus, like those, teeth of fish: White Seabream, Gilthead Bream, Red Snappers, and countless others of their kin: species which, after the first set of teeth, which end at the extremity of the mouth, were endowed by Nature with a very large second set of teeth lined up in fine order inside the mouth, both in the upper part, and in the lower. Their shape is exactly the same as the petrified ones of which group they are part, as everyone can see with their own eyes.  Therefore I will not fail to adapt into imagery some of their fleeced jowls {Plate II, Figs I, II, III & IIII} to compare their teeth with the petrified ones; in due course I will also draw further on in the greater quantity and variety in which I have been able to collect them, through many friends, from Malta; and I shall willingly do this not only as an expression of what I have seen, but also to establish with the drawings the basis for every eye to compare the sameness of the parts, and then to be able to understand the truth, that I aim to make known, which is that those stones, popularly called snakes` eyes, were once teeth, and parts of the mouths of White Seabream, Red Snappers, Gilthead Bream and the like, which swim and are fished in great numbers and variety, throughout the seas.‡

Scilla (1670) La diuersità de'colori poco monta ; fono cosi quefti , come cotesti , denti de’pesci , Sarco , Orata , Dentici , ed infiniti altri simili ; le spezie de’quali, dopo de'primi denti,che terminano cõ l’estremità della bocca , furono dotate dalla Natura d’una copia grandissima di denti con bell'ordine schierati ,e diffusi dentro di essa bocca, così nella parte di sopra, come nella di sotto . La figura è istessissima a gl'impietrati in qual si sia parte, come ogn’uno può co'proprij occhi osseruare. Non mancherò per tanto di ridurre a veduta alcune loro ganasce spolpate.a. per paragonare i loro denti con gl’impietrati, che pur disegnerò più sotto in quella maggiore,e varia quantità , che m’è stato possibile raccogliere,per via di molti amici, da Malta ; e questo non folamente per espressione della mia osseruazione volentieri faro ,ma anche per dar campo co’disegni ad ogn’occhio di riscontrarne l‘iftessità delle parti , e per poterne dopo comprendere la verità, che pretendo far conoscere , cioè, che quelle pietre , volgarmente dette occhi di serpe, furono un tempo denti , e parti della bocca de’Sarchi , Dentici , Orate , e simili , che in molto numero,e varietà per tutti i mari nuotano, e si pescano.‡

Scilla (1670) The diversity of colours increases little; these are thus, like those, teeth of fish: White Seabream, Gilthead Bream, Red Snappers, and countless others of their kin: species which, after the first set of teeth, which end at the extremity of the mouth, were endowed by Nature with a very large second set of teeth lined up in fine order inside the mouth, both in the upper part, and in the lower. Their shape is exactly the same as the petrified ones of which group they are part, as everyone can see with their own eyes.  Therefore I will not fail to adapt into imagery some of their fleeced jowls {Plate II, Figs I, II, III & IIII} to compare their teeth with the petrified ones; in due course I will also draw further on in the greater quantity and variety in which I have been able to collect them, through many friends, from Malta; and I shall willingly do this not only as an expression of what I have seen, but also to establish with the drawings the basis for every eye to compare the sameness of the parts, and then to be able to understand the truth, that I aim to make known, which is that those stones, popularly called snakes` eyes, were once teeth, and parts of the mouths of White Seabream, Red Snappers, Gilthead Bream and the like, which swim and are fished in great numbers and variety, throughout the seas.‡

Scilla (1670) And even though it may turn out a great bother for me, I wish to satisfy you by showing you a few teeth {Plate I} so that you may understand (bearing in mind the remaining, and very great number, which I omit) the very many varieties of teeth that there are in the mouth of one species of Dogfish, which commonly call the Columbine, or rather Devil Fish, and in that of an ordinary Dogfish; and the difference  that you will make out there will, I believe, make the argument for the dissimilarity, that of necessity applies to various animals, not only between species, but between those of the same species, for which reason the teeth of Dog Fish and Sharks whose bodies have grown in size are, for sure, transformed in shape from others of smaller specimens.‡

Scilla (1670) And even though it may turn out a great bother for me, I wish to satisfy you by showing you a few teeth {Plate I} so that you may understand (bearing in mind the remaining, and very great number, which I omit) the very many varieties of teeth that there are in the mouth of one species of Dogfish, which commonly call the Columbine, or rather Devil Fish, and in that of an ordinary Dogfish; and the difference that you will make out there will, I believe, make the argument for the dissimilarity, that of necessity applies to various animals, not only between species, but between those of the same species, for which reason the teeth of Dog Fish and Sharks whose bodies have grown in size are, for sure, transformed in shape from others of smaller specimens.

Scilla (1670) And even though it may turn out a great bother for me, I wish to satisfy you by showing you a few teeth {Plate I} so that you may understand (bearing in mind the remaining, and very great number, which I omit) the very many varieties of teeth that there are in the mouth of one species of Dogfish, which commonly call the Columbine, or rather Devil Fish, and in that of an ordinary Dogfish; and the difference that you will make out there will, I believe, make the argument for the dissimilarity, that of necessity applies to various animals, not only between species, but between those of the same species, for which reason the teeth of Dog Fish and Sharks whose bodies have grown in size are, for sure, transformed in shape from others of smaller specimens.

Scilla (1670) And even though it may turn out a great bother for me, I wish to satisfy you by showing you a few teeth {Plate I} so that you may understand (bearing in mind the remaining, and very great number, which I omit) the very many varieties of teeth that there are in the mouth of one species of Dogfish, which commonly call the Columbine, or rather Devil Fish, and in that of an ordinary Dogfish; and the difference that you will make out there will, I believe, make the argument for the dissimilarity, that of necessity applies to various animals, not only between species, but between those of the same species, for which reason the teeth of Dog Fish and Sharks whose bodies have grown in size are, for sure, transformed in shape from others of smaller specimens.

§ Physical description : 
Notes : Three teeth and partial jaw.

§ Comments : 
† Information type : Transcribed catalogue entry
Woodward (1729) "[mu]78. A Mass of Stone with, 2 large Teeth each, rising to an obtuse Point from a broad Bottom. These are serrated on the Edges, but the Serratures are deeper and grosser than in any of the rest. They lie both in the same manner and on the same Plane and there are some Remains of a third also in the same Plane, and at the same Distance. Ag. Scilla, Tab.xii. Fig.1. His Account of it is Tufo di Malta, che contiene una parte di Ganascia con tre denti incassati & petrificati. There is a Seam in the Stone, which is, I suppose, what he imagin’d to be the Jaw of the Fish, but nothing like a Jaw appears here. And in truth the Teeth of Fishes of the Dog-Fish Kind, are never infix’d in their Jaws; being only held on by means of Muscles, so that they can move them, raise them on end in their Mouths and lay them down flat again at pleasure."‡

Scilla (1670) Non così nell'altre spezie di marine bestie, le quali con una sola linea di denti fierissimi furono determinate dalla Natura; essendo che con molta facilità io le farò vedere, che non di rado s'incontra la soddisfazione , che nell'altre m'ha richiesto . Ella è in luogo di poterla procurare pienamente ; ne durerà molta diffìcultà per esiggerne uno, anzi più riscontri ; ed io, benchè lontano di Malta, conseruo appresso di me un bel pezzo di mascella con tre denti incassati .a. come per appagare [62] il desio di lei, a suo luogo mostrerò.‡

Scilla (1670) Not so in the other species of marine beasts, which were determined by Nature to have one sole line of very fierce teeth; it being with much ease that I will make you see that, which satisfaction is not often found on the other [occasions] you have requested such of me. You are in a position to be fully able to procure it; nor will it take much difficulty to represent one, indeed more than one validation; and I, although far from Malta, keep by my side a fine piece of jawbone with three embedded teeth { Plate XII, fig. I}, so as to [62:] satisfy your desire, as I will show in due course.‡

Woodward (1728) 'Several boney Bodies, from 4/10 to 8/10 (check) of an Inch in Length, of a flattish Shape, the broadest near 3/10 (check) of an Inch over. There run along the two opposite Flats of these Bodies, for their whole Length, parallel Lines ; which seem to be so many Commissures, and so the Bodies composed of several Plates joining at those Lines. I have not seen any thing exactly like them ; which is far from strange, considering the vast Diversity of Marine Animals yet un-described, and unknown, and how imperfect Accounts we have of the Parts of those that are known. These seem by their Structure, to have been of the Ossicula that are found in the Heads of some Kinds of Fishes, rather than Teeth. Dug out of the Earth in Malta. Ag. Scilla, after his Book was publish'd.'‡

† Information type : Transcribed catalogue entry
Woodward (1728) 'A boney body in figure somewhat approaching an oval, about an inch long, and ¾ of an inch over; consisting of several Tabellae placed horizontally one upon another, being composed of several small round bodies, some of them white, others yellow, each about ?/10 (check) of an inch in diameter. The body is not equally thick in all parts; and does not anywhere exceed ?/? (check) of an inch in thickness. This composition, the fineness of the colours, the smoothness and politeness of this body render it extremely elegant and beautiful. It seems to have been the boney palate of some kind of Fish*. There are besides this three Fragments more of the lame sort, one of which I caused to be cut ; and thence learned that it is very hard, and takes a good Polish. The upper Surfaces of these Palates are smooth, appearing to have been worn by the mastication and chewing of the Fish; for in such Parts in which the Plates are broken, or separated so as to discover those round Bodies within, where they have suffer'd any Attrition, as those in the Surface have, they appear to be each convex on one side, and concave on the other, the lower Orders of them being by that means inserted into, and join'd with the upper. From Malta. Ag.Scilla after his Book was out. *A considerable Part of the Mouth of the common Thornback is lined and covered with a Crust composed of small round Bodies, not unlike these in shape, but they are thinner, and in only one single Tabella.'‡

Woodward (1728) 'A Mass of a hard whitish Stone, in which are two or three Pectines, and many of the Concha Anomia, some of them broken, so as to show Spar concreted and crystalliz'd in the Cavities of them, which is very common in this and other Shells. Ag.Scilla. He calls these sparry Concretions in the Inside of the Shells, Corpi di Pesce petrificati, and shew'd them to his Antagonists for such, when they demanded of him why the Bodies should not be preserved as well as the Shells. From Messina. This he sent me for the Mass exhibited, Tab. XIX. Fig. 2. But if so, he took a little too much Liberty in his Icon, there being several Things in the Figure which are not in the Body. But indeed their ill Usage and Exasperations of him, and his zeal for maintaining his Argument, disposed him to take that Liberty in several other Particulars.'‡
